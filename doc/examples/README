                               Red Book Examples

 
INTRODUCTION
============

These examples are all in the OpenGL Programming Guide (the red book),
published by the Addison-Wesley Publishing Company; ISBN 0-201-63274-8.


HOW TO COMPILE THE EXAMPLE SOURCE CODES
=======================================

Before compiling the source codes, please make sure that Sun Java2 SDK has been
installed in the machine and acceptable. Since jGL has been developed on Java2
platform, Sun Java2 SDK, Standard Edition is recommended, the newest version is
1.3.1, and the official web site is:

	http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/

### The following lines will be deleted soon ###

To generate the html files for Java Plug-in, the Java Plug-in Software HTML
Converter is also needed. The official web site of Sun Java Plug-in 1.3.0_01
Software HTML Converter is:

	http://java.sun.com/products/plugin/1.3.0_01/converter.html

#################################################

Before making the example source codes, don't forget to download jgl.jar, the
pre-compiled byte-code jar-ball. The newest version will be at

	http://nis-lab.is.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~robin/jGL/pub/jgl.jar or
	http://www.cmlab.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~robin/jGL/pub/jgl.jar

To compile all the example source codes, please edit Make-config as necessary
to make sure that the path of Java2 SDK in the local file system are set
right. Then, just make the codes by

	make. 

It will make all the example source codes, and generate Java Plug-in HTML
files.


HOW TO COMPILE THE SOURCE CODES ON MICROSOFT WINDOWS SYSTEM
===========================================================

Please edit make.bat to make sure that the path of Java2 SDK in the local file
system are set right. Then, just make the codes by

	make.

It will make all the example source codes, and generate Java Plug-in HTML
files.


RUN THE EXAMPLES
================

To run the examples, please edit the booktest script (or booktest.bat) file to
make sure that the path of Java is correct. Don't forget to put the jgl.jar in
the same directory as these examples. Then, type

	booktest simple (for example)
